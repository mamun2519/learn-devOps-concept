### What Is Network

**⇒** Networking, or computer networking, is the process of connecting two or more computing devices, such as desktop computers, mobile devices, routers or applications, to enable the transmission and exchange of information and resources.

### How Does Net Work?

⇒ Computers connect to each other and to the Internet via wires, cables, radio waves, and other types of networking infrastructure. All data sent over the Internet is translated into pulses of light or electricity, also called "bits," and then interpreted by the receiving computer.

⇒ first user request DNS services DNS services Request Main Server

Example⇒ user ⇒ DNS ⇒ IP = NetFlix

### Role Of Networking In DevOps

### Basic Networking Concepts

- IP Address
- Private vs Public IP Address
- Dynamic vs static IP address assignment
- The concept of DHCP
- subnets

**IP Address**

- What are IP addresses?
  - 12.122.224.46
  - total 32 bit = 4 bytes
- Private vs public IP Addresses
- Example

### IP Classes

- Classes A,B and C are used on the internet
- Class D is reserved for multicast addresses
- class E isn't used currently.

### Subnet Introduction

- Subneting for network segmentation
  - Efficient Security
  - Simplified Management
  - Routing Efficiency
- Subnet Io Calculation
- CIDR Block
- Network Address
- Broadcast Ip

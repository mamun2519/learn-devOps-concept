### What Is Network

**⇒** Networking, or computer networking, is the process of connecting two or more computing devices, such as desktop computers, mobile devices, routers or applications, to enable the transmission and exchange of information and resources.

### How Does Net Work?

⇒ Computers connect to each other and to the Internet via wires, cables, radio waves, and other types of networking infrastructure. All data sent over the Internet is translated into pulses of light or electricity, also called "bits," and then interpreted by the receiving computer.

⇒ first user request DNS services DNS services Request Main Server

Example⇒ user ⇒ DNS ⇒ IP = NetFlix

### OSI Model

- Application (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Presentation (Syntax, security)
- Session (API, Socket)
- Transport (TCP)
- Network (Packets)
- Data Link (Ethernet)
- Physical
  ⇒ **Software Part:** Application, Presentation, Session, Transport

⇒ **Hardware Part:** Network, Data Link, Physical

### TCP/IP Layer

- Application
- Transport
- Internet
- Network Access

### IP Address

⇒**_An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network_**.
Note: IPV4 Is limited. that way lunch IPv6
⇒ Running Work Ipv4. this problem solve subNet.

### Subnet

⇒When a bigger network is divided into smaller networks, to maintain security, then that is known as Subnetting. So, maintenance is easier for smaller networks. For example, if we consider a [**class A address**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-classful-ip-addressing), the possible number of hosts is 224 for each network, it is obvious that it is difficult to maintain such a huge number of hosts, but it would be quite easier to maintain if we divide the network into small parts.

### What Is DNS

⇒ The Domain Name System (DNS) turns domain names into IP addresses, which browsers use to load internet pages. Every device connected to the internet has its own IP address, which is used by other devices to locate the device. DNS servers make it possible for people to input normal words into their browsers, such as [Fortinet.com](http://fortinet.com/), without having to keep track of the IP address for every website.

### What is VPC

⇒ A virtual private cloud (VPC) is the division of a service provider's [public cloud](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/definition/public-cloud) multi-tenant architecture to support [private cloud](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/definition/private-cloud) computing. VPCs are, therefore, a private cloud hosted within a public cloud architecture. This model enables an enterprise to achieve the benefits of private clouds (such as more granular control over virtual networks and an isolated environment) while using public cloud resources.

### What is Firewall

⇒ A firewall is a network security device designed to monitor, filter, and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. The primary purpose of a firewall is to establish a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks.

### What is a Load Balancer

⇒ **Load balancing is the process of distributing network traffic efficiently among multiple servers to optimize application availability and ensure a positive end-user experience.**

### What IS NAT

⇒ **Network Address Translation (NAT)** is a process in which one or more local IP addresses are translated into one or more Global IP addresses and vice versa to provide Internet access to the local hosts. It also does the translation of port numbers, i.e., masks the port number of the host with another port number in the packet that will be routed to the destination. It then makes the corresponding entries of IP address and port number in the NAT table. NAT generally operates on a [**router or firewall**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-router-and-firewall/).

### Role Of Networking In DevOps

- Infrastructure Provisioning
- Scalability and performance
- Continuous Integration and deployment
- Security Implementation
- Troubleshooting Network issues

### Basic Networking Concepts

- IP Address
- Private vs Public IP Address
- Dynamic vs static IP address assignment
- The concept of DHCP
- subnets

**IP Address**

- What are IP addresses?
  - 12.122.224.46
  - total 32 bit = 4 bytes
- Private vs public IP Addresses
- Example

### IP Classes

- Classes A,B and C are used on the internet
